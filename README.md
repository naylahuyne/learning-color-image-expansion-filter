# Introduction

This project aims at reimplementing learning algorithm proposed by Kanemura in the paper *LEARNING COLOR IMAGE EXPANSION FILTERS which can be accessed from [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5414405). 

# Result

The quality of expanded image measured by PSNR in the paper of image data\4.2.04.tiff is 33.63 (dB). The quality of expanded image using reimplemented version is 33.56 (dB).
